# Overview

This is a comprehensive e-commerce management system built for a shoe retailer called "Güllü Shoes". The application manages orders, products, inventory, and customer interactions through a Flask-based web application with PostgreSQL database integration via Neon hosting. The system integrates heavily with the Trendyol marketplace API for order management and product synchronization.

4. Barcode and shipping label generation
5. Status updates pushed back to Trendyol API
6. Completed orders archived for historical analysis

## Product Synchronization Flow
1. Product data fetched from Trendyol API
2. Local product database updated with inventory levels
3. Images downloaded and stored locally
4. Stock levels monitored and updated
5. Low stock alerts generated
6. Stock updates pushed back to Trendyol API

## User Interaction Flow
1. User authentication with optional 2FA
2. Role-based dashboard presentation
3. CRUD operations logged and cached
